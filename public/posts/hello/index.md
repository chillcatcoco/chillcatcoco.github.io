Welcome to ChillCatCoCo blog! I’m not sure why you’re here, but it’s great to have you. This blog’s source code is heavily inspired by [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) by Dan Abramov. I’ve refactored it into TypeScript, made some improvements, and created a separate config file to make it easier for others to customize their own sites.

Feel free to explore the source code on GitHub: [chillcatcoco.github.io](https://github.com/chillcatcoco/chillcatcoco.github.io)

```js eval
<div>
  <p className='text-2xl text-purple-400 dark:text-purple-500'>
    chillin' chillin'
  </p>
  <p>
    <ChillCat />
  </p>
  <p>
    <CounterButton />
  </p>
</div>
```
